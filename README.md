# smart_assist_project

SmartAssist is a Python-based intelligent assistant designed to improve human–computer interaction. The project integrates Text-to-Speech, Speech-to-Text, basic voice commands, and sign language gesture recognition using computer vision. It enables users to interact with the system through voice and hand gestures, making it more accessible and user-friendly. The system uses libraries such as MediaPipe, OpenCV, and SpeechRecognition to process real-time audio and video input.
